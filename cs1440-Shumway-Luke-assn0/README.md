## Overview

Your internship at DuckieCorp will be challenging, but we hope you find your management team and the tools we teach you about to be as helpful as possible during your time with us.

This first project is designed to refresh your Python and computer science skills.  For this project you will create an automated DuckieCrypt Decrypter.  DuckieCrypt is a proprietary encryption algorithm used internally for sensitive messages (With any luck we will find some customers to sell it to).  Although one *can* decrypt messages by hand, an automated tool will significantly cut down the time needed to decrypt while increasing accuracy.

DuckieCorp has given you a small set of exercises located in the [`lsn/`](lsn) directory of the starter code repository.  These exercises test the Python skills used to create the DuckieDecrypter, slowly building you up so you can create the decrypter with ease. More on these exercises below.

After completing the exercises you will be ready to tackle the DuckieDecrypter. The instructions and specifications for crafting the DuckieDecrypter will be found inside the file at [`instructions/Instructions.md`](instructions/Instructions.md) directory. It is advised to familiarize yourself with the instructions for the DuckieDecrypter before starting the lessons so you can make the most connection between the material found in [`lsn`](lsn) and the construction of our decrypter.


## Objectives

-   Become familiar with the command line interface
-   Learn the basics of the git version control system
    -   Understand the benefits of version control
    -   Practice correctly submitting an assignment to GitLab
-   Understand how real-world software projects are organized
-   Answer your own questions by reading source code
-   Review Python language concepts
    -   Arithmetic & logic
    -   Loops & conditions
    -   String operations
    -   Responding to user input
-   Opening and reading files in Python


## Guided lessons

Under the `lsn` directory are three lessons designed to assist you in learning the necessary skills to create the DuckieDecrypter. These lessons will only be provided with this task for our interns.

Each lesson consists of
*   a `README.md` file explaining the lesson.  There may be other `.md` files, too.
*   `ex*.py` files to be completed according to the specifications in `README.md`.
*   `runTests.py` which is run to verify completion of the associated lesson.

These lessons will be assessed according to the completion of the exercise and the passage of the associated unit tests. View [the README in the `lsn` directory](./lsn) for more info on running the `runTests.py` file from each `lsn` subdirectory.

### Topics of the lessons

0.  Start in [`0-ASCIIChars/`](lsn/0-ASCIIChars) to learn about ASCII characters and ordinal values.
1.  Next, head into [`1-TextProcessing/`](lsn/1-TextProcessing) to learn how to process text line by line and word by word in Python.
2.  Finally, [`2-FileOperations/`](lsn/2-FileOperations) will teach you how you can open, read and close files in Python.

**These exercises will be graded.**

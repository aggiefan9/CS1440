I really like how in Luke's UML diagram he specifies when the type of a varible is a Instance of a certain class.
It makes it certain that you know what is in the variable, and leaves no room for doubt.
  I think that his Deck object might be missing a few variables, but that could be a consequence of his design decisions.
I do think it's good that he has written out the types of his arguments to be passed to the functions, but I think it
would be even better if he had some nice, well named variable names associated with the types of variables passed to the
methods in the classes.
  Luke, despite coming up with his UML diagram separately has the same dependecies listed as I do, which though not
always the case, can show that the UML diagram has some logic and sense present in it, and in fact, his separation of
concerns with the Deck, Card and NumberSet classes separated from the Menu and MenuOption classes almost has the same
idea as a Model View Controller design pattern if you ask me, with the Deck and associated classes representing the
model, the UserInterface representing the controller, which interfaces the two separate branches together and the Menu
and MenuOption classes representing the view.
  Also, his variables have a consistent naming scheme though he does seem to be missing some that might be important to
the functionality.
  At the end of the day, Luke's UML diagram is very good, if possibly incomplete. It makes up for this in his explicit
use of types and his good variable names.
